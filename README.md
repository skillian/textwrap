# textwrap

Wrap strings to specific column widths, moving words that stretch across those boundaries to the next line.  Also works with io.Readers!

## Example

Check out the [textwrap.String](https://github.com/skillian/textwrap/blob/8feb5f24b3b3fff3475ce31293ffa0aa12759f98/textwrap.go#L11) function for a good example of how to use the `textwrap.Reader` type.
